# Leap Years kata

Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not.

A leap year is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.


For example, **2001 is a typical common year** and **1996 is a typical leap year**, whereas **1900 is a typical common year** and **2000 is a typical leap year**.
